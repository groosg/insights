# Hello there :wave:

My name is Groosg, I'm a software engineer with experience in building and
running applications and distributed systems. More recently, I have been
focusing on the security of applications and cloud environments.

I decided to put together this website to have some fun and to share technical
stuff. I don't know exactly which stuff but I think we'll figure this out.

I hope you enjoy the content. For feedback and interaction, you can find me
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gr00sg) :fontawesome-brands-twitter:{ .twitter }.

    Speaking of Twitter, this website was created live on Twitter and this was really fun
    - [check this out](https://twitter.com/gr00sg/status/1558226720309780480).
